# **What in the world is this bot**?
This is a bot developed by **Meolsei#4905** on [**Discord**](https://www.discord.com) using [**Rapptz'**-](https://github.com/Rapptz) open-source Discord API wrapper written for Python, [**discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). I am developing this Discord bot for a content creator's Discord server.
